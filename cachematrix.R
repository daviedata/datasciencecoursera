## Programming Assignment 2


## The two functions  help in caching the inverse of a matrix.
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there 
## may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather 
## than compute it repeatedly. 

## The first function, makeVector creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to

## 1. set the value of the vector
## 2. get the value of the vector
## 3. set the value of the mean
## 4. get the value of the mean

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
  getmean <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setmean = setmean,
       getmean = getmean)

}


## The following function calculates the mean of the special "vector" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the mean has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getmean()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- mean(data, ...)
  x$setmean(m)
  m
}
